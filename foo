This is an edit from Niels
This is an edit from Monte


This is an edit from Monte, I am adjusting the edit to include something more here.

	Hi Niels, the idea is that we can create a merge conflict and that way we better understand how to fix this.
	For clarity, this is a merge conflict in that we are both editing the same file.

Just adding some more lines,I'll add some text maybe numbers?  so that we can use this again for later.


Adding more and more lines to foo, let's call it Foo Fighters

is that ok?
